# Natural Disaster Emergency Response App - Design Document

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Status:** Approved

## Overview

A location-aware emergency response web application for civilians affected by major natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods). The app auto-detects when users are in an active disaster zone and provides an interactive map centered on their immediate area, allowing them to request help, view nearby emergency resources, and receive live updates.

## Core Concept

This is a **region-specific emergency response app** that gets deployed for specific disaster events. When a disaster occurs (e.g., earthquake in Turkey), users in the affected area choose their role and access relevant features.

### Role-Based System

**Initial Screen:**
When users open the app, they see two options:
- **"I Need Help"** (Victim role)
- **"I Want to Provide Help"** (Responder/Volunteer role)

**Victim Role Features:**
- Request help with specific needs (medical, food, shelter, rescue)
- View own help request status
- See nearby emergency resources (shelters, hospitals, water stations, safe zones)
- Receive official news updates and alerts
- Navigate to emergency resources
- **Cannot see** other victims' help requests (reduces information overload)

**Responder/Volunteer Role Features:**
- View all nearby help requests from victims on the map
- Filter help requests by type and urgency
- Mark themselves as "responding" to a specific request
- See emergency resources to coordinate relief efforts
- Receive official news updates and alerts
- **Cannot create** help requests (they're there to provide assistance)

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Radix UI** primitives (Dialog, Sheet, Tabs, Toast)
- **Shadcn/UI** components built on Radix
- **Google Maps JavaScript API** for interactive mapping
- **Lucide React** for icons

## User Flow

### Initial Role Selection
1. User opens app → Auto-detects GPS location
2. Role selection screen appears with two large options:
   - "I Need Help" (victim role)
   - "I Want to Provide Help" (responder role)
3. User selects role → Stored in localStorage for session persistence

### Victim Flow (After selecting "I Need Help")
1. Map loads centered on user's neighborhood (zoom ~15)
2. Map shows:
   - User location marker (pulsing blue)
   - Emergency resource markers (green) - shelters, hospitals, water stations
   - Disaster zone boundary (polygon overlay)
   - **No other victims' help requests visible**
3. Persistent "Request Help" FAB (bottom-right) always visible
4. Left slide-in panel with tabs: Alerts, News, Resources, My Requests
5. User can request help, view resources, get directions, read updates

### Responder Flow (After selecting "I Want to Provide Help")
1. Map loads centered on user's neighborhood (zoom ~15)
2. Map shows:
   - User location marker (pulsing blue)
   - **All nearby help request markers** (color-coded by urgency: red/orange/yellow)
   - Emergency resource markers (green)
   - Disaster zone boundary (polygon overlay)
3. No "Request Help" FAB (responders don't request help)
4. Left slide-in panel with tabs: Alerts, News, Help Requests, Resources
5. User can view help requests, mark as responding, filter by type/urgency, navigate to victims

## Map System (Google Maps API)

### Configuration
- **API:** Google Maps JavaScript API with custom dark theme
- **Initial View:** User's GPS location, zoom level 15 (neighborhood detail)
- **Map Type:** Hybrid (satellite + street labels)
- **Styling:** Dark theme, desaturated colors to emphasize markers

### Map Elements

**User Location:**
- Pulsing blue marker with circular radius showing immediate area

**Help Request Markers (Responder Role Only):**
- Custom SVG markers with icon badges (medical, food, shelter, rescue, other)
- Color-coded by urgency:
  - Red: Critical
  - Orange: Urgent
  - Yellow: Standard
- Marker clustering for dense areas (Google Maps MarkerClusterer)
- **Not visible to victims** (only responders see these)

**Emergency Resources:**
- Green custom markers for:
  - Hospitals/Medical centers
  - Emergency shelters
  - Water distribution points
  - Safe zones

**Disaster Zone Boundary:**
- Polygon overlay with subtle red tint and glowing border
- Shows full extent of affected area

### Interactions
- Click marker → Opens detail sheet from right side
- Hover marker → Info window with type, urgency, distance
- Search → Google Places API autocomplete, smooth pan/zoom
- Layer toggles → Show/hide different marker types
- Get Directions → Route to selected location

## UI Layout & Components

## Mock Data Approach

Since there's no backend yet:
- **User Role:** Stored in localStorage, managed by useUserRole hook
- **Help Requests:** Local state (useState/useReducer) + localStorage (simulates real-time updates)
- **News Updates:** Mock data file with sample updates
- **Emergency Resources:** Mock data file with sample locations
- **Alerts:** Mock data file with sample alerts
- **Geolocation:** Browser Geolocation API (with override for testing)
- **Responder Actions:** Stored in localStorage (tracking which responder claimed which request)

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1: Project Setup**
   - Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript in `frontend/` directory
   - Configure Tailwind with custom glassmorphic dark theme
   - Set up Shadcn/UI components
   - Install Google Maps dependencies
   - Create basic type definitions

2. **Phase 2: Role Selection**
   - Build RoleSelection screen component
   - Implement useUserRole hook with localStorage
   - Create role switching functionality
   - Design glassmorphic role selection cards

3. **Phase 3: Core Map (Role-Aware)**
   - Implement MapContainer with Google Maps
   - Add user location detection and marker
   - Create custom marker components (help requests, resources)
   - Apply dark theme styling to map
   - Conditional marker rendering based on user role

4. **Phase 4: UI Layout (Role-Aware)**
   - Build Header component with role indicator
   - Create Request Help FAB (victim role only)
   - Implement left slide panel with role-specific tabs
   - Build right detail panel with role-specific actions

5. **Phase 5: Victim Features**
   - Request Help dialog and form
   - My Requests tab showing victim's own requests
   - Emergency Resources tab
   - News/Updates and Alerts tabs

6. **Phase 6: Responder Features**
   - Help Requests feed showing all nearby requests
   - Filters for help requests (type, urgency, distance)
   - "I'm Responding" action to claim requests
   - Status updates when responders claim requests

7. **Phase 7: Map Interactions**
   - Marker clustering (help requests for responders)
   - Click handlers for marker details
   - Search/autocomplete with Google Places
   - Layer toggles
   - Directions integration

8. **Phase 8: Polish**
   - Responsive design refinement
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Toast notifications for actions
   - Loading states and skeletons
   - Error handling
   - Role switching confirmation dialogs

## Success Criteria

- App loads and shows role selection screen
- User can choose between victim and responder roles
- Role persists across page refreshes
- User location is detected automatically
- Map displays with dark glassmorphic theme styling

**Victim Role:**
- Can create help requests via FAB
- Help requests stored and shown in "My Requests" tab
- Can see emergency resources on map
- Cannot see other victims' help requests
- Can view news, alerts, and resources

**Responder Role:**
- Can see all nearby help requests on map as markers
- Can filter help requests by type, urgency, status
- Can claim requests with "I'm Responding" action
- Cannot create help requests (no FAB visible)
- Can view news, alerts, and resources

**General:**
- Panels slide in/out smoothly
- All tabs show relevant mock data
- Responsive on mobile and desktop
- Glassmorphic theme applied consistently
- User can switch roles via settings
